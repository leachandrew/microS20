# Economists Speak a Foreign Language...

.pull-left[

- Terms you "know" from ordinary life mean *very different things* to economists:

> Cost, efficiency, welfare, competition, marginal, equilibrium, profit, public good, discrimination, elasticity

- Using these words' "ordinary" meanings will lead to wrong economic conclusions!

- You will need to "relearn" the economic meanings of these words

# ...But You Can Learn It

.pull-left[

- You'll need to master a new vocabulary:

# Takeaways About Incentives I

.pull-left[

- People respond to (changes in) incentives<sup>1</sup>

- People have different goals they seek to attain

- Blocking one alternative $\neq$ people stop persuing their goals

- People will seek (less preferred) alternative methods of attaining their goals

- People are creative, and many consequences are *unintended*

# Optimization and Equilibrium

# Reminder: Positive vs Normative Economics

- You may vehemently disagree with certain policies, institutions, or market outcomes
- All I ask is you allow us to explain *why* they occur
- You will miss useful explanations (and the ability to improve things you disapprove of) if you are blinded by your judgment
- You may disapprove of gravity, but you are bound by it

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often "speak" in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The pure language of models is mathematics
    - things that are universally true, deducible from axioms, can easily spot errors
    - often equations and graphs
    - this is what scares students most about economics

# Why We Model II

.pull-left[

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Very different from other sciences
    - No social experiments
    - Purposive, strategic human beings 
    - Introspective understanding

# The Two Major Models of Economics as a "Science"

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have objectives they value

- Agents face constraints

- Make tradeoffs to maximize objectives within constraints

]

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents face competition from others that affect prices

- Agents adjust their behaviors based on prices

- Stable outcomes result where all agents cease adjusting

# Model 1: Optimization

    - Should the U.S. legalize marijuana?
    - Which college courses should I pick?
    - Which political campaign platform will win the most votes?
    - Which path minimizes travel time?

    - Why is the price of Apple iPhones so high?

    - Can big companies secretly all raise prices together?
    - Are markets with only a few sellers actually competitive?
    - How can we coordinate our actions to reduce climate change?
    - Why is doping so prevalent in professional sports?

# About This Course

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. apply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments

2. explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures)

3. apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing
