- As explore other aspects of firm behavior, we need more tools from game theory beyond a one-shot prisoners' dilemma

- We've seen examples of .hi-purple[continuous strategies] in Cournot, Bertrand, & Stackelberg competition
  - Firms can choose a wide range of prices, outputs
  - One-shot prisoners' dilemma we had two .hi-purple[discrete] choices

- Seen .hi-purple[simultaneous] (prisoners' dilemma) vs. .hi-purple[sequential] game (Stackelberg)

- Assumed .hi-purple[common knowledge] about the game structure. Everyone knows all players, all their potential strategies, and all of their payoffs

- .hi[Perfect information] (players can observe moves of others, as in sequential game) vs. .hi[Imperfect information] players cannot observe moves of others (Prisoners' Dilemma)

- We use .hi-purple["solution concepts"] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- .hi[Nash Equilibrium] is the primarly solution concept
  - Note it has many variants depending on if games are sequential vs. simultaneous, perfect vs. imperfect information, etc.

- Important about N.E.:
  - N.E. $\neq$ the "best" pr optimal outcome
    - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!
  - Game may have **multiple** N.E.
  - Game may have **no** N.E. (in "pure" strategies)

- We consider an .hi[Entry Game], a .hi-purple[sequential] game played between a potential .hi-red[Entrant] and an .hi-blue[Incumbent]

- A sequence of play: .hi-red[Entrant] moves first, .hi-blue[Incumbent] moves second

- Note: the magnitude of the payoffs don't really matter, only their **relative sizes**
  - Hence, my simple numbers

- This game is depicted in .hi-purple["Extensive form"] or a .hi-purple[game tree]

- Each player faces at least one .hi-purple["decision node"] (solid, colored by player)
  - .hi-red[Entrant] chooses between .red[Enter] or .red[Stay Out] at node .red[E.1]
  - .hi-blue[Incumbent] chooses between .blue[Accommodate] or .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]

- We need to talk more about .hi[strategies]

- .hi[Pure strategy]: a player's *complete* plan of action for every possible contingency
  - i.e. what a player will choose at *every* possible decision node
  - think like an algorithm:
  
> if we reach node 1, I will play X; if we reach node 2, I will play Y; if ... 

- .hi-purple["Mixed strategy"]: play a strategy with some probability

  1. .blue[Accommodate] at .blue[I.1]
  2. .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]

- .hi[Backwards induction]: to determine the outcome of the game, start with the **last-mover** (i.e. decision nodes just before terminal nodes)

- What is that mover's best choice to maximize their payoff?

  - .blue[Accommodate] to earn .blue[1]
  - .blue[Fight] to earn .blue[0]

# Contestable Markets I

.pull-left[

- Model the market as an .hi-purple[entry game], with two players:

1. .hi-red[**Incumbent**] which sets its price $\color{red}{p_I}$

2. .hi-blue[**Entrant**] decides to **stay out** or **enter** the market, setting its price $\color{blue}{p_E}$

- Bertrand price competition between the two firms with similar products $\implies$ consumers buy only from the firm with the lower price

# What About *Sunk* Costs? I

.pull-left[
- Fixed costs $\implies$ do not vary with output

- If firm exits, could sell these assets (e.g. machines, real estate) to recover costs
  - Thus, .hi-purple["hit-and-run" competition] remains potentially profitable
  - Maintains .hi-purple[credible threat] against incumbent acting as a monopolist

# What About *Sunk* Costs? II

.pull-left[
- These are bygones to the .hi-red[Incumbent], who has already committed to producing

- But are *new* costs and risk to .hi-blue[Entrant], lowering expected profits

- In effect, sunk costs raise $\color{blue}{c_E}>\color{red}{c_I}$, and return us back to our second example

- .hi[Nash equilibrium]: .hi-red[Incumbent] deters entry with $\color{red}{p_I}=\color{blue}{p_E}-\epsilon$
  - Inefficient, $p>AC$, but again not monopoly

# Contestable Markets: Recap

.pull-left[
- .hi-purple[Markets are **contestable** if]:
  1. There are no barriers to entry or exit
  2. Firms have similar technologies (i.e. similar cost structure)
  3. There are no sunk costs
  
- Economies of scale need not be inconsistent with competitive markets (as is assumed) if they are contestable

- Generalizes "prefect competition" model in more realistic way, also game-theoretic

- In perfect competition (model):
  - price-taking firms set price equal to marginal cost
  - long run economic profits are zero

- **Don't judge real markets by their similarity to the perfect competition model**

- Judge them more on their level of contestability, ease of potential entry
