# Producer Behavior

.pull-left[

- How do **producers** decide:
    - which products to produce
    - in what quantity
    - using which resources
    - and for what price? 

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for **supply curves**

- Entrepreneurs and shareholders are the only participants in production that are *not* guaranteed an income!
    - Starting and owning a firm is inherently **risky**!

# A Peek Inside the Corporate Veil I
