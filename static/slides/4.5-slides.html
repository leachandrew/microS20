- As explore other aspects of firm behavior, we need more tools from game theory beyond a one-shot prisoners' dilemma

- We've seen examples of .hi-purple[continuous strategies] in Cournot, Bertrand, &amp; Stackelberg competition
  - Firms can choose a wide range of prices, outputs
  - One-shot prisoners' dilemma we had two .hi-purple[discrete] choices

- Assumed .hi-purple[common knowledge] about the game structure. Everyone knows all players, all their potential strategies, and all of their payoffs

- We use .hi-purple["solution concepts"] to allow us to predict an .hi-purple[equilibrium] of a game

- .hi[Nash Equilibrium] is the primarly solution concept
  - Note it has many variants depending on if games are sequential vs. simultaneous, perfect vs. imperfect information, etc.

- Important about N.E.:
  - N.E. `\(\neq\)` the "best" pr optimal outcome
    - Recall the Prisoners' Dilemma!
  - Game may have **multiple** N.E.
  - Game may have **no** N.E. (in "pure" strategies)

- We consider an .hi[Entry Game], a .hi-purple[sequential] game played between a potential .hi-red[Entrant] and an .hi-blue[Incumbent]

- A sequence of play: .hi-red[Entrant] moves first, .hi-blue[Incumbent] moves second

- Note: the magnitude of the payoffs don't really matter, only their **relative sizes**
  - Hence, my simple numbers

- This game is depicted in .hi-purple["Extensive form"] or a .hi-purple[game tree]

- Each player faces at least one .hi-purple["decision node"] (solid, colored by player)
  - .hi-red[Entrant] chooses between .red[Enter] or .red[Stay Out] at node .red[E.1]
  - .hi-blue[Incumbent] chooses between .blue[Accommodate] or .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]
  - Game ends at any .hi-purple["terminal node"] (hollow node), and each player earns payoffs (.red[Entrant], .blue[Incumbent])

- We need to talk more about .hi[strategies]

- .hi[Pure strategy]: a player's *complete* plan of action for every possible contingency
  - i.e. what a player will choose at *every* possible decision node
  - think like an algorithm:
  
&gt; if we reach node 1, I will play X; if we reach node 2, I will play Y; if ... 

- .hi-purple["Mixed strategy"]: play a strategy with some probability

  2. .blue[Fight] at .blue[I.1]

- .hi[Backwards induction]: to determine the outcome of the game, start with the **last-mover** (i.e. decision nodes just before terminal nodes)

- What is that mover's best choice to maximize their payoff?

2. .hi-blue[**Entrant**] decides to **stay out** or **enter** the market, setting its price `\(\color{blue}{p_E}\)`

# What About *Sunk* Costs? I

- Fixed costs `\(\implies\)` do not vary with output

- If firm exits, could sell these assets (e.g. machines, real estate) to recover costs

  - Maintains .hi-purple[credible threat] against incumbent acting as a monopolist

# What About *Sunk* Costs? II

.pull-left[
- These are bygones to the .hi-red[Incumbent], who has already committed to producing

- But are *new* costs and risk to .hi-blue[Entrant], lowering expected profits

- In effect, sunk costs raise `\(\color{blue}{c_E}&gt;\color{red}{c_I}\)`, and return us back to our second example

- .hi[Nash equilibrium]: .hi-red[Incumbent] deters entry with `\(\color{red}{p_I}=\color{blue}{p_E}-\epsilon\)`
  - Inefficient, `\(p&gt;AC\)`, but again not monopoly

# Contestable Markets: Recap

.pull-left[
- .hi-purple[Markets are **contestable** if]:
  1. There are no barriers to entry or exit
  2. Firms have similar technologies (i.e. similar cost structure)
  3. There are no sunk costs
  
- Economies of scale need not be inconsistent with competitive markets (as is assumed) if they are contestable

- Generalizes "prefect competition" model in more realistic way, also game-theoretic
