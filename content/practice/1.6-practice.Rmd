You can get utility from consuming Soda $(s)$ and Hot dogs $(h)$, according to the utility function:

$$u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}$$

The marginal utilities are:

$$\begin{align*}
MU_s&=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5}	\\
MU_h&=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}$$

You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.

## 1. 
#### What is your utility-maximizing bundle of Soda and Hot dogs?

## 2. 
#### How much utility does this provide?
