The demand for monthly cell phone plans is given by:

$$q_D =  50-0.5p$$

## 1. 
Write the *inverse* demand function.

## 2. 
Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $10. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

## 3. 
Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $70. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?

## 4. 
At what price is demand unit elastic $(\epsilon=-1)$?

## 5.
Calculate the total revenue at $10.

## 6.
Calculate the total revenue at $70.

## 7.
Calculate the total revenue at the price you found for question 4.
