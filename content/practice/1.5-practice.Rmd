# 1 

For each question, draw an indifference curve relating the two objects (label it $I_1$). Draw and label a *second* curve that gives *higher* utility (label it $I_2$), and a *third* curve that gives *lower* utility (label it $I_0$).

## a. 
*Oranges* (a good) on the horizontal axis and *Pollution* (a bad) on the vertical axis. 

## b.
*Pollution* (a bad) on the horizontal axis and *Soda* (a good) on the vertical axis.

## c.
*Pollution* (a bad) on the horizontal axis and *Garbage* (a bad) on the vertical axis.

## d.
*Butter* on the horizontal axis and *Margarine* on the vertical axis. Both are goods, and you are always willing to trade between them at a 1:1 rate.

## e.
*Cars* on the horizontal axis and *Tires* on the vertical axis. Both are goods, and you are always want to consume them at a 1:4 proportion. (Draw these carefully!)


# 2 

Suppose you can watch movies in the theater ($t$) and streaming at home ($s$), and earn utility according to the utility function: 
$$u(t,s)=4ts$$

Where your marginal utilities are: 
$$\begin{align*}
MU_t&=4s\\
MU_s&=4t\\ \end{align*}$$

## a. 
Put $t$ on the horizontal axis and $s$ on the vertical axis. Write an equation for $MRS_{t,s}$ 

## b. 
Would bundles of $(2,2)$ and $(1,4)$ be on the same indifference curve?

## c.
Is this curve convex? Hint: Does $MRS_{t,s} \downarrow$ as $t \uparrow$? 

## d.
Sketch this indifference curve.
