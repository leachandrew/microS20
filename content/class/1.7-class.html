<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Solving a single constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the <em>dynamics</em> of change are more interesting: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. If we can describe this set of behaviors in an equation and graphically, it is the origin of a demand curve.</p>
<p>Today, we look at how changes in <em>income</em> or changes in the prices of <em>other</em> goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.</p>
<p>In doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an <em>elasticity.</em> You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.</p>

<h2 id="assignments-problem-sets-1-2-and-exam-1">Assignments: Problem Sets 1, 2, and Exam 1</h2>
<p><a href="/assignment/01-problem-set">Problem set 1</a> (on classes 1.1-1.6) is posted, and is due by Thursday February 13.</p>
<p><a href="/assignment/02-problem-set">Problem set 2</a> (on classes 1.7-1.9) is also posted, and is due by Thursday February 20. You will not be able to do everything on it until we complete class 1.9.</p>
<p>We will do a review day on Thursday, February 20. Expect Exam 1 to be on Tuesday, February 25.</p>
