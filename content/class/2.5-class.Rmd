# Overview

- *Tuesday, March 23, 2020*
- *Quarantine Lecture 1*

Today we finish up costs from last lecture, and discuss revenues before we put them together next class to solve the firm's *profit maximization problem*. We focus on the *short run*, where the firm incurs fixed costs and must stay in the market regardless. We derive the firm's (inverse) *supply curve*.
