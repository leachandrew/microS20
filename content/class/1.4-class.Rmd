# Overview

We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class, and next, is what are people's *objectives*? How can we operationalize their preferences in a meaningful way? Today we will discuss one tool - indifference curves - and start an explanation of *utility* and how we can model people as trying to "maximize" it (we will wrap that up in the next class).

## Utility Functions and PMTs

Two utility functions $u(\cdot)$ and $v(\cdot)$ represent the same preferences iff there is a *strictly* increasing function} $f$ such that $v(\cdot)=f\left[u(\cdot)\right]$

$$\begin{aligned}
a&=(1,2)\\
b&=(2,2)\\
c&=(4,3)\\
\end{aligned}$$

The following utility functions express the same preferences:

| $u(\cdot)$ | $v(\cdot)$ |
|------------|------------|
| $u(a)=1$   | $v(a)=2$   |
| $u(b)=2$   | $v(b)=4$   |
| $u(c)=3$   | $v(c)=6$   |

$$v(\cdot)=2\left[u(\cdot)\right]$$

A **positive monotonic transformation (PMT)** transforms quantities such that the rank order of the quantities is preserved.

- Examples: $v(u)=u+2; \, v(u)=4u; \, v(u)=u^3; \, v(u)=ln(u)$

*Any PMT of a utility function contains the same preferences!*
