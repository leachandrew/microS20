      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Survey Math Review   Thursday, January 23, 2020
Overview We begin with an overview of constrained optimization models and our first application, how individuals choose. Our primary focus will be people as consumers - how do they choose to spend their money and how do those choices change? While we will focus extensively on consumers making purchasing choices, do not think this is the only use of this type of model!</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Appendix Utility Functions and PMTs    Tuesday, January 28, 2020
Overview We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class, and next, is what are people’s objectives? How can we operationalize their preferences in a meaningful way? Today we will discuss one tool - indifference curves - and start an explanation of utility and how we can model people as trying to “maximize” it (we will wrap that up in the next class).</description>

Overview We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class is to wrap up what we mean by “maximizing utility” as a person’s objective. We will do some practice problems on understanding indifference curves and utility functions.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Assignment: Problem Set 1 Math Appendix Solving the Constrained Optimization Problem with Calculus    Thursday, February 6, 2020
Overview Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer’s constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use Lagrangian multipliers and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make intuitive sense.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Assignments: Problem Sets 1, 2, and Exam 1   Tuesday, February 11, 2020
Overview Solving a single constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the dynamics of change are more interesting: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. If we can describe this set of behaviors in an equation and graphically, it is the origin of a demand curve.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Interactive Examples Practice Problems Assignments: Problem Set 1 is DUE and Problem Set 2 Math Appendix Example Demand Functions Cobb-Douglas    Thursday, February 13, 2020
Overview Today we cover the third effect: the (own) price effect, aka the law of demand: how changes in a good’s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good. We introduce the idea of demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve.</description>

Overview Today we look at price elasticity of demand, and wrap up our Unit 1 on Consumer/Individual choice theory.
A reminder, your second problem set is due next class; next class is our review session, and we will have Exam 1 on Tuesday October 1 (for Section 1 - TuTh) and Wednesday October 2 (for Section 2 - MW).</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides    Thursday, February 27, 2020  Overview Today we start looking on the supply side of the market for the next few weeks. You will ultimately see, we will use the same tools (and get basically the same results!) for studying producers (constrained optimization models) as we did for consumers. Sometimes, these models finally “click” for students the second time around, and production is often more intuitive than utility and consumption.</description>

      <description> Contents  Overview Slides Survey   Overview Before we jump into our optimization models to descibe and predict (changes in) individual choices and behavior, we cover the basic principles of choice and action in a world of scarcity. This is what motivates economics.
