      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Survey Math Review   Thursday, January 23, 2020
Overview We begin with an overview of constrained optimization models and our first application, how individuals choose. Our primary focus will be people as consumers - how do they choose to spend their money and how do those choices change? While we will focus extensively on consumers making purchasing choices, do not think this is the only use of this type of model!</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Appendix Utility Functions and PMTs    Tuesday, January 28, 2020
Overview We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class, and next, is what are people’s objectives? How can we operationalize their preferences in a meaningful way? Today we will discuss one tool - indifference curves - and start an explanation of utility and how we can model people as trying to “maximize” it (we will wrap that up in the next class).</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Appendix Graphing Indifference Curves Utility Functions for Perfect Complements Utility Functions for Perfect Complements Cobb-Douglas Functions    Overview We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class is to wrap up what we mean by “maximizing utility” as a person’s objective. We will do some practice problems on understanding indifference curves and utility functions.</description>

      <title>Class 2: Scarcity, Choice, and Cost</title>
      <link>https://microS20.classes.ryansafner.com/class/1.2-class/</link>

      <description> Contents  Overview Slides Survey   Overview Before we jump into our optimization models to descibe and predict (changes in) individual choices and behavior, we cover the basic principles of choice and action in a world of scarcity. This is what motivates economics.
