Your firm can use labor $l$ and capital $k$ to produce output according to the production function:
$$q=4lk$$


The marginal products are:

$$\begin{aligned}
MP_l &=4k \\
MP_k &=4l \\ \end{aligned}$$

Suppose you  need to produce 144 units, the price of labor is \$10, and the price of capital is \$40. 

\begin{questions}

\question What is the least-cost combination of labor and capital that produces 144 units of output?

  \begin{solution}
  	Use the definition of the optimum: 
\begin{align*}
MRTS_{l,k}&=\frac{w}{r} & & \text{Definition of the optimum}\\
\frac{MP_l}{MP_k}&=\frac{w}{r} && \text{Definition of MRTS on left}\\
\frac{4k}{4l} &=\frac{(10)}{(40)} & & \text{Plugging in what we know}\\
		\frac{k}{l}&=\frac{1}{4} && \text{Simplifying}\\
	k&=\frac{1}{4}l && \text{Multiplying both sides by} l\\	
\end{align*}

So we know that we will be using 1 unit of capital for every 4 workers (this should make sense, as capital is 4 times as expensive as labor). This is the optimal ratio of inputs. 

To find the exact quantities of $l$ and $k$, use the production function:

\begin{align*}
q&=4lk & & \text{The production function}\\
144&4l(\frac{1}{4}l) & & \text{Plugging in what we are given and what we found}\\
144&=l^2 & & \text{Multiplying}\\
12&=l & & \text{Square rooting both sides}\\
\end{align*}

Now that we know the quantity of labor, we can use our knowledge of the ratio of labor to capital to find the optimal quantity of capital. 
\begin{align*}
k&=\frac{1}{4}l\\
k&=\frac{1}{4}(12)\\
k&=3\\ 	
\end{align*}

So using 12 workers and 3 units of capital produces 144 units of output at the lowest total cost.
\end{solution}

\question How much does this combination cost?

\begin{solution}

\begin{align*}
wl+rk&=C && \text{The isocost line equation}\\
10(12)+40(3)&=C && \text{Plugging in what we know (prices) and what we found}\\
120+120&=C && \text{Multiplying}\\
240&=C && \text{Adding}\\
\end{align*}

The total cost of using 12 workers and 3 units of capital at current prices is \$240.

\end{solution}

\question Does this technology experience constant returns, increasing returns, or decreasing returns to scale?

\begin{solution}

Simply plug in combinations of labor and capital that change at the same rate, and see at what rate output changes. For example, with 1 worker, 1 unit of capital, output is:

\begin{align*}
q&=4lk\\
q&=4(1)(1)\\
q&=4
\end{align*}

If we now *double* all inputs, so that we use 2 workers and 2 units of capital, output is

\begin{align*}
q&=4lk\\
q&=4(2)(2)\\
q&=16
\end{align*}

Output has quadrupled from 4 to 16, from a doubling of all inputs. Therefore, this technology exhibits increasing returns to scale.

There is a shortcut that we could use, because this function is in Cobb-Douglas format (inputs and \emph{multiplied} by each other, and each raised to an exponent), we can simply sum the exponents:

$$q=4l^{1}k^{1}$$
$$1+1=2$$

Because the exponents sum to a number greater than one, this technology is increasing returns. Be careful, this shortcut method \emph{only} works for Cobb-Douglas functions!
