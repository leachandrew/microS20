      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can get music via downloads (\(d\)) or concert tickets (\(t\)). You have $60 to spend each week, and the price of a download is $3 and the price of a concert ticket is $10. Put \(d\) on the horizontal axis and \(t\) on the vertical axis.
1 Write the equation for your budget constraint.
 2 Solve this equation for \(t\), to express the equation of the line.</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  1 For each question, draw an indifference curve relating the two objects (label it \(I_1\)). Draw and label a second curve that gives higher utility (label it \(I_2\)), and a third curve that gives lower utility (label it \(I_0\)).
a. Oranges (a good) on the horizontal axis and Pollution (a bad) on the vertical axis.
 b. Pollution (a bad) on the horizontal axis and Soda (a good) on the vertical axis.</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can get utility from consuming Soda \((s)\) and Hot dogs \((h)\), according to the utility function:
\[u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}\]
The marginal utilities are:
\[\begin{align*} MU_s&amp;amp;=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5} \\ MU_h&amp;amp;=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}\]
You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can spend your income on apples and oranges. Apples currently cost $0.25 and oranges cost $0.50. When your income is $40, you buy 10 apples and 8 oranges. When your income increases to $80, you buy 12 apples and 6 oranges.
1. What type of good are apples (inferior, necessity, luxury)?
 2. What type of good are oranges (inferior, necessity, or luxury)?</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  The demand for monthly cell phone plans is given by:
\[q_D = 50-0.5p\]
1. Write the inverse demand function.
 2. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $10. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?
 3. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $70. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?
 4. At what price is demand unit elastic \((\epsilon=-1)\)?</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  Your firm can use labor \(l\) and capital \(k\) to produce output according to the production function: \[q=4lk\]
The marginal products are:
\[\begin{align*} MP_l &amp;amp;=4k \\ MP_k &amp;amp;=4l \\ \end{align*}\]
Suppose you need to produce 144 units, the price of labor is $10, and the price of capital is $40.
1. What is the least-cost combination of labor and capital that produces 144 units of output?</description>
