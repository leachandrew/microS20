      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can get utility from consuming Soda \((s)\) and Hot dogs \((h)\), according to the utility function:
\[u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}\]
The marginal utilities are:
\[\begin{align*} MU_s&amp;amp;=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5} \\ MU_h&amp;amp;=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}\]
You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  Your firm can use labor \(l\) and capital \(k\) to produce output according to the production function: \[q=4lk\]
The marginal products are:
\[\begin{align*} MP_l &amp;amp;=4k \\ MP_k &amp;amp;=4l \\ \end{align*}\]
Suppose you need to produce 144 units, the price of labor is $10, and the price of capital is $40.
1. What is the least-cost combination of labor and capital that produces 144 units of output?</description>
