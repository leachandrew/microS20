      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  1 For each question, draw an indifference curve relating the two objects (label it \(I_1\)). Draw and label a second curve that gives higher utility (label it \(I_2\)), and a third curve that gives lower utility (label it \(I_0\)).
a. Oranges (a good) on the horizontal axis and Pollution (a bad) on the vertical axis.

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can get utility from consuming Soda \((s)\) and Hot dogs \((h)\), according to the utility function:
\[u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}\]
The marginal utilities are:
\[\begin{align*} MU_s&amp;amp;=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5} \\ MU_h&amp;amp;=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}\]
You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  The demand for monthly cell phone plans is given by:
\[q_D = 50-0.5p\]
1. Write the inverse demand function.
 2. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $10. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?
 3. Calculate the price elasticity of demand when the price is $70. Is this relatively elastic or inelastic?
 4. At what price is demand unit elastic \((\epsilon=-1)\)?</description>
