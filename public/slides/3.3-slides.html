- Applications in electives (this semester):
  - Industrial Organization
  - Labor Economics
  - Public Economics

- Models help us *understand* reality, but they *are not* reality!
  - Don't mistake the map for the territory itself

- Our models so far have given us interesting results, 
  - Markets reach equilibrium
  - Economic profits are zero in the long run in competitive markets

- Both are **fictional**

- But the models **still** show us useful insights about how a market economy works

- Some readings in today's readings page to help you understand

- As these gains are exhausted, prices converge to equilibrium
