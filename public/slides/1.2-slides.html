- Acting with **purpose** is what distinguishes humans from everything else in the universe

- Artificial intelligence researchers face "*the frame problem*"
    - We thought: computation is hard, perception is easy

Carl Menger

.right-column[

&gt; Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence, value does not exist outside the consciousness of men (pp. 120-121).

# Three Insights About Value

.pull-left[

- Value is .whisper[subjective]
    - Each of us has our own preferences that determine our ends or objectives
    - Preferences are **not comparable** across individuals
    - Only individuals know what alternatives they give up at the moment of choice

# Three Insights About Value

.pull-left[

- Value is measured as an .whisper[ordinal] concept 
    - We can *rank* our objectives relative to each other (but cannot quantify further)
    - We pursue highest-valued objectives (highest marginal utility) first
    - Pursuing one objective means *not* pursuing others!

# Three Insights About Value

.pull-left[

- Value inherently comes from the fact that we must make .whisper[tradeoffs]
    - Pursuing one objective means *not* pursuing others!
    - The objective we pursue at the moment must be worth the sacrifice of others! (i.e. highest marginal utility)
