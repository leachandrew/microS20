      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Survey Math Review   Thursday, January 23, 2020
Overview We begin with an overview of constrained optimization models and our first application, how individuals choose. Our primary focus will be people as consumers - how do they choose to spend their money and how do those choices change? While we will focus extensively on consumers making purchasing choices, do not think this is the only use of this type of model!</description>

  Now that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings for each class.
We are going a bit out of order in two ways. First, Goolsbee et. al start with a review of Supply and Demand in chapters 2-3, and don’t get to “Consumer Theory” (what we are starting now) until chapter 4.</description>

Overview We continue with our model of how individuals choose. Our focus for this class, and next, is what are people’s objectives? How can we operationalize their preferences in a meaningful way? Today we will discuss one tool - indifference curves - and start an explanation of utility and how we can model people as trying to “maximize” it (we will wrap that up in the next class).</description>

Overview Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer’s constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use Lagrangian multipliers and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make intuitive sense.</description>

\[u(s,h)=\sqrt{sh}\]

\[\begin{align*} MU_s&amp;amp;=0.5s^{-0.5}h^{0.5} \\ MU_h&amp;amp;=0.5s^{0.5}h^{-0.5} \\ \end{align*}\]
You have an income of $12, the price of Soda is $2, and the price of a Hot dog is $3. Put Soda on the horizontal axis and Hot dogs on the vertical axis.</description>

Overview Solving a single constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the dynamics of change are more interesting: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income. If we can describe this set of behaviors in an equation and graphically, it is the origin of a demand curve.</description>

Sometimes, these models finally “click” for students the second time around, and production is often more intuitive than utility and consumption.</description>

  Download as PDF  Answer Key  Please write your answers to the following questions on a piece of paper, or download and print a PDF copy (link above) to write on. You may also type your answers and print out a hard copy.
You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, pick one question to grade for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</description>
