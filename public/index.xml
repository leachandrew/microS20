      <title>1.3 Constrained Optimization and the Budget Constraint - Readings</title>

      <description>Recommended   Ch. 4.3 in Austan Goolsbee, Steven Levitt, and Chad SyversonMicroeconomics, 2nd ed. (USA: Worth Publishers, 2012).
  Now that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings for each class.
We are going a bit out of order in two ways. First, Goolsbee et. al start with a review of Supply and Demand in chapters 2-3, and don’t get to “Consumer Theory” (what we are starting now) until chapter 4.</description>

      <description>Contents  Overview Slides Practice Problems Math Survey Math Review   Overview We begin with an overview of constrained optimization models and our first application, how individuals choose. Our primary focus will be people as consumers - how do they choose to spend their money and how do those choices change? While we will focus extensively on consumers making purchasing choices, do not think this is the only use of this type of model!</description>

      <description>Download as PDF  Answer Key  You can get music via downloads (\(d\)) or concert tickets (\(t\)). You have $60 to spend each week, and the price of a download is $3 and the price of a concert ticket is $10. Put \(d\) on the horizontal axis and \(t\) on the vertical axis.
1 Write the equation for your budget constraint.
 2 Solve this equation for \(t\), to express the equation of the line.</description>

      <description>Grade Calculator   Grade Calculator  Use this tool to calculate your final course grade and predict what grades you would need on remaining assignments to obtain a desired course grade.
Homeworks There will be roughly a homework assignment for every lesson. These questions will help check your understanding and mastery of the material, and will be a combination of quantitative, graph, and short answer questions of examples. These will also be good indicators of what to expect on the exams.</description>

      <description>Contents  Tips for Success Math Review List of Math Appendices Interactive Examples   Look here over the course of the semester for resources, links, and tips on how to succeed in the course, how to write well, and other things of interest related to microeconomics.
Tips for Success Take notes. On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand.</description>
